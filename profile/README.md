## EdBiomedAI

This is the Github organisation of the research groups of [Ava Khamseh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/ava-khamseh-research-group)
 and [Sjoerd Beentjes](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/sjoerd-beentjes-affiliate) located at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, as well as Schools of Informatics and Mathematics, Edinburgh, UK.
 
 We are a group of cross-disiplinary researchers, and have members with backgrounds in Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics.
 
 Using rigourous mathematical, statistical, machine-learning and causal inference frameworks, such as Targeted Learning, we work on
 
 1. Identifying causal molecular markers of disease in the UK biobank (e.g. genotype, expression, ...) (in collaboration with [Chris Ponting](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/ponting-group) and [Mark van der Laan](https://vanderlaan-lab.org/about/))
 2. Identifying novel treatments using high-content, high-throughput screenings (in collaboration with [Neil Carragher](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cancer-centre/research/carragher-group))
 3. Pinpointing drivers and mutational competition in early liver cancer (in collaboration with [Luke Boulter](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/boulter-group))

We believe in an open, collaborative approach to Science.
