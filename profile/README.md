## EdBiomedAI

This is the Github organisation of the research groups of [Ava Khamseh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/ava-khamseh-research-group)
 and [Sjoerd Beentjes](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/sjoerd-beentjes-affiliate) located at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, as well as Schools of Informatics and Mathematics, Edinburgh, UK.
 
 We are a group of cross-disiplinary researchers, and have members with backgrounds in Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics.
 
 Using rigourous mathematical, statistical, and machine-learning frameworks, such as Targeted Learning, we work on
 
 1. Identifying causal molecular markers of disease in the UK biobank (e.g. genotype, expression, ...) (in collaboration with Chris Ponting)
 2. Identifying novel treatments using high-content, high-throughput screenings (in collaboration with Neil Carragher)
 3. Pinpointing drivers of liver cancer (in collaboration with Luke Boulter)

We belive in an open, collaborative approach to Science.
