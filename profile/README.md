## EdBiomedAI

This is the Github organisation of the groups of [Ava Khamseh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/ava-khamseh-research-group)
 and [Sjoerd Beentjes](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/ava-khamseh-research-group).
 
 We are a group of cross-disiplinary researchers, and have members with backgrounds in Mathematics, Phyiscs, Statistics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics.
 
 Using rigourous mathematical, statistical, and machine-learning frameworks, such as Targeted Learning and Super Learners, we work on
 
 1. Identifying causal molecular markers of disease in the UK biobank (e.g. genotype, expression, ...)
 2. Identifying novel treatments using high-content, high-throughput screenings (in collaboration with Neil Carragher)
 3. Pinpointing drivers of liver cancer (in collaboration with Luke Boulter)

We belive in an open, collaborative approach to Science.
